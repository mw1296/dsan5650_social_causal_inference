    "## The HW3 Methodology: *Evaluating* Our Estimated Models on Test Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodologically, this part will introduce you to a piece of the causal-analysis pipeline that you're probably/hopefully used to from other DSAN classes, but which we haven't touched on much yet in 5650. Namely, the **train-test split** approach to evaluating our models and distinguishing between \"better\" and \"worse\" models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Splitting** our data into **training** and **test** subsets, and then\n",
    "* **Evaluating** them on a relevant metric of predictive accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Although **accuracy** often feels intuitively like the most appropriate evaluation metric, in most machine learning contexts it turns out to be not so helpful, since e.g. it rewards ML algorithms that just always guess the most-common class rather than actually learning the statistical relationship of interest. If we're trying to diagnose a rare disease that only occurs in 1% of the population, for example, the ML algorithm can achieve 99% accuracy by just always predicting no-disease (rather than learning to **distinguish** the disease cases from non-disease cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in general, for discrete classification tasks the [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) is usually more appropriate. In this assignment, though, we will be **predicting probabilities** of being hired for individuals with different characteristics, which entails using the [AUC metric](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc) to evaluate the *tradeoff* between false positives and false negatives as we change the **threshold** for predicting a hiring from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Overview of ROC Curve $\\rightarrow$ AUC Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Since that last sentence is a bit vague, a more direct way of understanding this **threshold-based** evaluation is as follows. Once you've trained a model in PyMC, you can use its `.sample_predictive_posterior()` function to obtain a bunch of simulated datasets **generated by** the model (on the basis of its now-estimated parameter valuers). Since the default number of draws is 500, this corresponds to 500 generated hire/no-hire values for each individual in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these 500 hire/no-hire guesses for $i$ in hand, you can then compute their **mean** to obtain a point estimate of the model's **estimated probability that this individual $i$ is hired**. We'll call this mean $\\hat{p}_i$, then use it to **evaluate** the model's predictions by constructing an **ROC Curve** via the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  First, we set up a plot in the $xy$-plane, where both $x$ and $y$ range from 0 to 1, and where the the $x$-axis is labeled **false positive rate** and the $y$-axis is labeled **true positive rate**.\n",
    "2.  To get our first point on this **ROC Curve**, we set a threshold of **$\\theta = 0.0$** for positive prediction. Meaning, we \"convert\" the predicted probabilities $\\hat{p}_i$ generated by our model into actual predictions via the rule\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{Prediction}_i(0.0) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "      1 &\\text{if }\\hat{p}_i \\geq 0.0 \\\\\n",
    "      0 &\\text{otherwise}\n",
    "    \\end{cases}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    This will then generate some number of correct predictions (for all cases where person $i$ was actually hired), but also a bunch of false positives, since it's predicting 1 *no matter what*. So, we compute the False Positive Rate $FPR = \\frac{\\# FP}{\\# FP + \\# TN}$ under this prediction rule (where $\\#$ means \"number of\", and $TN$ means \"true negatives\", so $\\# TN$ means \"number of true negatives\"), along with the True Positive Rate $TPR = \\frac{\\# TP}{\\# TP + \\# FN}$, and add a point to the ROC curve created in the previous step at exactly the coordinates $(FPR, TPR)$.\n",
    "3.  Then, we **increase the threshold** by some increment (say, $0.1$), and re-do Step 1. Meaning, we now generate a new set of predictions using the rule\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{Prediction}_i(0.1) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "      1 &\\text{if }\\hat{p}_i \\geq 0.1 \\\\\n",
    "      0 &\\text{otherwise}\n",
    "    \\end{cases}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    And, like in the previous step, this will generate a False Positive Rate $FPR$ and a True Positive Rate $TPR$, which we plot as a second point in our ROC Curve.\n",
    "4.  We continue with this process, incrementing the threshold $\\theta$, generating predictions via\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{Prediction}_i(\\theta) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "      1 &\\text{if }\\hat{p}_i \\geq \\theta \\\\\n",
    "      0 &\\text{otherwise}\n",
    "    \\end{cases}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    and then adding the resulting $(FPR, TPR)$ point to our ROC Curve until we reach $\\theta = 1.0$ (at which point we're classifying every point as *negative*/no-hire, no matter what!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot obtained using this method is called the **ROC Curve**, and if you think about the difference between a \"fake\" learning method that just randomly guesses between 0 and 1, and the \"real\" learning that you hope your chosen ML algorithm is performing, you'll arrive at the result that a good measure of \"How well is my algorithm doing relative to random-guessing?\" is precisely the **area underneath the curve**, or **AUC**, generated by connecting the points plotted in Steps 1 through 4 above. A random-guessing algorithm will obtain an **AUC** of 50%, whereas ML algorithms that more effectively **distinguish** the positive from the negative cases will have AUC scores which exceed 50%."

    "So, going off of *just* this survey-based investigation, we might think that the only salient variable we'd need to include would be one indicating **whether or not the applicant has a prior conviction**. In other words, this seems to indicate that we can \"capture\" employer behavior(🧐)---say, in order to make accurate **predictions** of job-applicant success---using only prior-conviction status. A tabulation of how often employers say they would likely hire an applicant, by race, seems to confirm this visual intuition, with the white Chad vignette eliciting only a slightly higher `sayhire` probability than the black Chad vignette:"

    "One of the more confusing aspects of Bayesian modeling at first, admittedly, is that from frequentist-stats world we're used to obtaining **point estimates** of things, and then maybe **standard errors** describing our uncertainty about these point estimates... In Bayes world, model results are **not** point estimates of things, but entire **distributions** over possible values of the things! Therefore, as mentioned above, rather than 137 estimates of `sayhire` values (which would be either `0` or `1`), we have **4000 draws** from the posterior distribution of each survey's `sayhire` value: 4 Markov chains, each of which produces 1000 estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a ton of cool stuff that this having-a-distribution-rather-than-a-point-estimate unlocks for us, so it's actually a shame to collapse it all back down into point estimates 😭. But, to be able to evaluate its predictive performance as a probabilistic classifier of `sayhire` values, we'll do this collapsing: in the following cell, compute the **mean** over all 4000 draws of `sayhire` for each `response_id` in the dataset, so that you end up with just a **vector** of 137 means with the name `nofeats_train_means`. (Note that, you can transform the vector into a Pandas `Series` object, as I've done in class, or you can just keep it in PyMC's default `xarray` format; either one will work with the provided `plot_roc()` function).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your `nofeats_train_means` vector of \"predicted scores\" is ready, the provided code at the end of the cell includes a `plot_roc()` function that we'll use from here on out to compare these predictions with the **observed** `sayhire` values in the training data. The function displays the ROC curve visually, then returns the numeric AUC metric value. Since this is just the **training** performance, we don't save it anywhere, but the fact that `plot_roc()` returns the AUC value will be important when we compute the **test** performance in the next step!"

    "One thing to note, before we dive into evaluating our model's performance on the **test** data, is that because of the stochastic split of the data into training and test sets, we expect the test set to have slightly different statistical properties from the training set! The theoretical point of the train-test split is to simulate **two** random draws from a larger population, with the training \"draw\" being 4 times larger than the test \"draw\".\n",

    "You should see that the proportion of test observations with a `sayhire` value of `1` is slightly **lower** than the proportion of training observations with a `sayhire` value of `1`. So, to the degree that our model has fallen prey to **overfitting**, e.g. to the degree that it has just tried to **\"memorize\"** the training data rather than trying to **generalize** from it to the population it was drawn from, our **test** performance will be worse. (Which again, is the point of the priors in Bayesian data analysis!) This doesn't matter so much for our baseline model, since its just to check whether our \"real\" models are improving upon this baseline, but it's good to keep this in mind now as we move forward!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cell, you'll need to do something you didn't have to do for the training data evaluation. You'll need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Update the data** in `nofeats_model` so that it now has the **test** features as its observations (which will also require providing a new `coords` value, as the second argument to `pm.set_data()`, corresponding to the `response_id` values in the **test** data. Then, once the model's observed data has been updated,\n",
    "2.  **Re-estimate** the posterior predictive distribution using `pm.sample_posterior_predictive()`, remembering to include `random_seed=5650`, and store the **35 newly-generated `sayhire` distributions** (one per label in `y_test`) in a variable named `nofeats_test_idata`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you should **not re-run `pm.sample()`** to generate these test predictions! In fact, if you do, it will just re-estimate the entire model (with the test data now just becoming the new training data), so that you will no longer be evaluating the model's **generalizability** to unseen data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this `set_data()` $\\rightarrow$ `pm.sample_posterior_predictive()` approach can be a bit daunting, we've made your lives a bit easier by just providing the code for extracting `sayhire` means and plotting the ROC curve. So, just focus on generating the posterior predictive distribution over the **test** data!"

    "We can see that, no matter how wide the range of values we \"plug into\" $\\text{logit}^{-1}(\\cdot)$ is, it will always compress these values to be between $0$ and $1$, and thus into a value which can be used as the $p$ parameter in our Bernoulli variable `sayhire`!\n",

    "\n",
    "On top of the details above about the utility of $\\text{logit}^{-1}(\\cdot)$ for our model, there's one more factor we'll need to consider for our model: what terms specifically to include as **features!** It's kind of... not obvious *a priori*, in a given modeling scenario, whether or not you should include or omit features representing **interactions** between individual features. In this case, however, there's a good reason to include this interaction term.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to take it on faith that there's a good reason and get on with the homework, **you can <span style='background-color: rgba(255,220,116,0.5);'>skip the following mathy stuff and move on to Q1.5.1</span>**!\n",

    "But, don't worry! This part won't involve another 7 tedious steps of doing the same thing you did in Part 1! Instead, we'll use it as an opportunity to explore a package called [**Bambi**](https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/), which is essentially a wrapper around more in-the-weeds Bayesian model-building tools like PyMC.\n",
