   This study investigates the causal relationships between race, industry, recent graduate, education attainment and unemployment rates in the United States by applying probabilistic graphical modeling (PGM) to uncover latent dependency structures across demographic and industry variables. Using a PGM framework, we construct conditional dependence networks to examine two primary dimensions: racial disparities and industry-specific unemployment dynamics. The analysis first explores the effect of race on unemployment disparities, followed by a sectoral analysis focused on Educational and Health Services, Financial Activities, Public Administration, Information, Leisure and Hospitality, Manufacturing, Professional and Business Services, Transportation and Utilities, and Wholesale and Retail Trade. This study aims to identify whether certain groups—such as Black workers and those employed in Leisure and Hospitality—face heightened unemployment risk, providing a more comprehensive view of labor market hardship. The model estimates the strength and direction of probabilistic dependencies using Bayesian structure learning algorithms, based on BLS Current Population Survey (CPS) data from 2015 to 2025. Findings reveal significant causal effects between race and industry on unemployment. In particular, Black workers in the Leisure and Hospitality sector face notably higher unemployment vulnerability compared to their White and Asian counterparts. Moreover, Leisure and Hospitality exhibits the strongest positive causal effect on unemployment likelihood. This study also explores the causal inference of the recent graduates on unemployment rate under the interactive effect with their education attainment (Bachelor's or Master's) in order to understand whether recent graduates have higher unemployment rate than non-recent graduates in 2025, and the difference between persons who have Bachelor's degree vs. those with Master's degree. These results contribute to the growing literature leveraging PGMs for social inference (e.g., Li et al., 2022), and demonstrate the model’s utility in uncovering structural labor market inequalities across population subgroups.

## Introduction

In its revised report released on July 31, 2025, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported a sharp slowdown in job creation beginning in May, signaling heightened uncertainty and growing concerns about the overall health of the U.S. labor market. The interplay of demographic characteristics and labor market dynamics consistently reveals significant disparities in unemployment rates. Decades of research reveal a persistent relationship between race, gender, and unemployment, evident across diverse economic cycles. Though the Black unemployment rate fell to a historic low of 6.1% in 2019, it was still twice as high as the White unemployment rate of 3.0%, as @ValerieWilson2022 observed. These disparities are further magnified at the intersection of race and gender. For instance, Black men faced a 6.1% unemployment rate in February 2024, notably higher than Black women at 4.4%. Similarly, Hispanic women's unemployment rate increased to 5.0% in February 2024, while Hispanic men experienced a decrease to 4.0% (@Joseph2024). Industry-specific analyses similarly highlight divergent unemployment trends. The Leisure and Hospitality sector reported the highest unemployment rate at 6.0% in 2024, an increase from 5.5% in 2023. Similarly, Wholesale and Retail Trade experienced elevated unemployment, reaching 4.7% in October 2024, up from 4.0% in 2023. Conversely, Financial Activities maintained a significantly lower unemployment rate of 1.9% (@Oberlo2024). 

Research from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics consistently shows longer unemployment spells in sectors such as Manufacturing and Construction, while industries demanding specialized skills like Education and Health Services exhibit shorter durations. Study by @YiLiChienandPaulMorris reveals negative correlation between the unemployment rate and duration. Such variations in both the rate and duration of unemployment underscore complex interactions among race, gender, age, and industry.

@TOIEducation2025 published that the labor market for recent college graduates has "deteriorated noticeably" in the first quarter of 2025. The unemployment rate for this cohort (ages 22-27) ranged from 5.5% to 7.1%, exceeding the overall national average of 4.1-4.2%, with Anthropology (9.4%), Physics (7.8%), and Computer Engineering (7.5%) showing among the highest rates.

Based on revised job reports for May through Jul 2025 released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on July 31, 2025, the new job creation numbers show a significant decline since May, raising substantial concerns regarding the stability of the U.S. labor market. Recent data clearly indicate a noticeable uptick in the unemployment rate for the 22-27 age group since March, reaching 2021 levels and particularly affecting recent college graduates (@fig-graduates). 

In this study, we are analyzing how race, gender, industry, age and the interactions of these features impact the disparities in the unemployment rate using BLS published historical labor force statistics and survey data.

BLS data from 2015–2025 indicate that the Black or African American population experienced the highest average unemployment rate (7.5%), primarily within the 5–10% range. Gender differences are minimal, with both averaging around 5%, though rates are slightly higher for men. Among industries, Leisure and Hospitality recorded the highest unemployment (10%) with a long-tail distribution, followed by Agriculture (5–11%) and moderate variability. Construction and Mining/Oil & Gas exhibit similar but marginally lower patterns. The 22–24 age group stands out with significantly elevated unemployment—averaging 7% and predominantly above 5%—while other age groups display lower and more uniform rates. Financial Activities show the lowest and most stable unemployment, consistently under 5%. Individuals without a high school diploma face high and variable unemployment, averaging 7% with a long-tail skew. These patterns suggest that young adults (22–24), Black or African Americans without college degrees, and those employed in Leisure, Construction, or Mining sectors are disproportionately affected by higher unemployment.

import seaborn as sns
df_industry = df_dic['Industry']
df_industry = df_industry[~df_industry['Year'].isin([2020,2021])]
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (14,10))
sns.boxplot(df_industry, x="Industry", y="Unemployment_rate", color='skyblue', ax=ax)
ax.tick_params(axis='y', labelsize=10)

ax.set_ylabel('Unemployment Rate', fontsize=12)
ax.set_title('Distribution of Unemployment Rate by Industry', y = 1.02, fontsize=16)
ax.tick_params(axis='x', labelsize=13, rotation=90)
```

The boxplot illustrates notable variation in unemployment rates across industries. "Agricultural, mining/oil/gas extraction" and "Construction" industries exhibit the highest variation and upper extremes, indicating greater instability in employment. Due to the volatility and unpredictivity as a result of seasonlity, these two categories are going to be excluded from our analysis. In contrast, "Government", "Financial services", and "Education/health services" show consistently low and stable unemployment rates, with narrower interquartile ranges and fewer outliers. These patterns suggest structural differences in labor market vulnerability across sectors. (@fig-boxplot-unemployment-rate-industry).


## PGM
We posit that unemployment vulnerability is driven by structural inequalities within the labor market, particularly those rooted in demographic and industrial dimensions. Demographic disparities are represented by variables such as race, age, and educational attainment and industry; sex is excluded from the analysis due to prior findings indicating minimal impact on unemployment rates. Establishing a baseline unemployment level is a necessary step before assessing the marginal effects of these demographic and industrial factors.

### Race model - Baseline unemployment rate distribution 
Figure 3 illustrates that the population unemployment rate is right-skewed, suggesting that the Log-Normal distribution is an appropriate model. We are going to estimate the parameters of a Log-Normal distribution from the population distribution data using MLE. ($\sigma$, $\text{loc}$, and $\text{scale}$).

```{python}
#| label: fig-histogram-lognorm
#| fig-cap: Unmployment Rate Histogram vs. Fitted Log-Norm PDF
#| fig-alt: Plot the histogram of unemployment rate data and overlay the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the fitted log-norm distribution.

# Fit log-norm distribution using population unemployment rate data
from scipy.stats import lognorm, kstest, skew 

## Get the unemployment_rate data that is not NA, convert to array
data_to_fit = df_overall_long[~np.isnan(np.array(df_overall_long['Unemployment_rate']))]['Unemployment_rate']

sigma_fit, loc_fit, scale_fit = lognorm.fit(data_to_fit) # Fit log-normal distribution

# Print the estimated parameters
print(f"\nFitted Log-Norm Distribution Parameters:")
print(f"  Shape parameter 'alpha'): {sigma_fit:.2f}")
print(f"  Location parameter (loc): {loc_fit:.2f}")
print(f"  Scale parameter (scale): {scale_fit:.2f}")

# Visualize the fit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 9))
## Histogram of the unemployment data
ax.hist(data_to_fit, bins=30, density=True, alpha=0.6, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black', label='Data Histogram')
## Fitted log-norm pdf
xmin, xmax = ax.get_xlim()
x = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, 100)
p = lognorm.pdf(x, sigma_fit, loc=loc_fit, scale=scale_fit)
ax.plot(x, p, 'darkred', lw=2, label='Fitted Log-Normal PDF')
ax.set_xlabel('Unemployment Rate', fontsize=10)
ax.set_ylabel('Density', fontsize=10)
ax.legend()
ax.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.suptitle("Data Histogram vs. Fitted Log-Normal Distribution PDF", y=1.02, fontsize=18)
plt.show()
```

By overlaying the smooth PDF curve on top of original data's histogram, we can visualize that the Log-Normal distribution matches the distribution of the actual data. The peak of the PDF align with the peak of the histogram. The spread of the PDF roughly match the spread of the data, including the tail (@fig-histogram-lognorm).
Now we need to use Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test to test Goodness-of-fit with the original data and estimated parameters, then examine the p value. 


```{python}
# KS goodness of fit test
d_statistic, p_value = kstest(data_to_fit, lambda x: lognorm.cdf(x, sigma_fit, loc=loc_fit, scale=scale_fit)) 
print(f"\nKolmogorov-Smirnov Test Results:")
print(f"  D-statistic: {d_statistic:.4f}")
print(f"  P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

```

With $p$-value < 0.05, we can't reject the hypothesis that the distribution does not come from the Log-Normal distribution, suggesting Log-Normal is not a good fit for the data. Next, explore other right-skewed distributions - Gamma distribution or the Weibull distribution.

```{python}
#| label: fig-histogram-gamma
#| fig-cap: Unmployment Rate Histogram vs. Fitted Gamma PDF
#| fig-alt: Plot the histogram of unemployment rate data and overlay the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the fitted Gamma distribution.

# Fit gamma distribution using MLE
from scipy.stats import gamma, skew, kstest
alpha_fit, loc_fit, scale_fit = gamma.fit(data_to_fit) # fit gamma distribution

# Print the estimated parameters
print(f"\nFitted Gamma Distribution Parameters:")
print(f"  Shape parameter 'alpha': {alpha_fit:.2f}")
print(f"  Location parameter 'loc': {loc_fit:.2f}")
print(f"  Scale parameter 'scale'): {scale_fit:.2f}")

# Visualize the fit
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (10, 8))
## Histogram of the unemployment data
ax.hist(data_to_fit, bins = 20, density=True, color='skyblue', alpha= 0.7, edgecolor='black', label = 'Data Histogram')
xmin, xmax = ax.get_xlim()
x = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, 100)

## Plot fitted gamma pdf
p = gamma.pdf(x, alpha_fit, loc=loc_fit, scale=scale_fit)
ax.plot(x, p, 'darkred', lw=2, label='Fitted Gamma PDF')
ax.set_xlabel('Unemployment Rate', fontsize=10)
ax.set_ylabel('Density', fontsize=10)
ax.legend()
ax.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.suptitle("Data Histogram vs. Fitted Gamma Distribution PDF", y=1.02, fontsize=18)
plt.show()
```

Although visually the Gamma distribution matches the shape and spread of the actual data. (@fig-histogram-gamma), we need to
use KS Test to test Goodness-of-fit by examining the p value. 

```{python}
# Fit the gamma 
d_statistic, p_value = kstest(data_to_fit, lambda x: gamma.cdf(x, alpha_fit, loc=loc_fit, scale=scale_fit))
print(f"\nKolmogorov-Smirnov Test Results:")
print(f"  D-statistic: {d_statistic:.4f}")

Again, with $p$-value < 0.05, we can not confidently say that the data comes from the Gamma distribution. Next, explore Weibull distribution.

The overlayed smooth PDF curve on top of original data's histogram @fig-histogram-weibull suggests that the Weibull distribution matches the distribution of the actual data. The results of the Weibull distribution, summarized in Table @tbl-weibull-params, including the shape, location, and scale parameters, along with the D-statistic, P-value, and fitted mean also proves Weibull distribution is a good fit, supported by a KS test p-value of 0.1173 (greater than 0.05). The estimated parameters (c=0.7093, loc=3.2000, scale=0.9204) align well with the spread of the data. Shape (c<1): Confirms the strong right-skewness of the data. Location (loc=3.2000): Indicates the distribution starts around 3.20, matching data's lower bound. Inferred Mean: The calculated mean of approximately 4.35 from these parameters is close but slightly higher than the data's actual mean of around 4, showing a good capture of central tendency.

### Race model - Define the prior means for overall population
```python
### population unemployment mean probability from the fitted Weibull distribution
weibull_fitted_mean_prob = 0.0435
# Convert the fitted mean probability to its log-odds equivalent in order to model binary outcome with logistic regression
population_mean_log_odds = np.log(weibull_fitted_mean_prob / (1 - weibull_fitted_mean_prob))
print(f"population mean log-odds: {population_mean_log_odds:.4f}")
```

The corresponding beta_effect for each of three races are shown in table above. These beta parameters are additive race effect parameter on population mean.

### Race model - Train-test split
Before PyMC - Split survey data to train and test datasets in order to test the performance of the models

The bar plot above (@fig-bar-race-model) demonstrates that the PGM race model predicts unemployment rates well. It accurately captures the highest unemployment rate for the Black race, closely matching the survey data. However, the model tends to overestimate the unemployment rate for the Asian group compared to the observed values.

The scatter plot (@fig-scatter-industry-unemployment) compares true and predicted unemployment rates for each industry. Most industries show close alignment between the two measures, indicating good predictive accuracy. Alghouth Leisure and hospitality and Information show slightly higher gaps, suggesting the model under- or overestimates unemployment rates. Industries such as Leisure and hospitality and Information exhibit the highest unemployment rates, both in true and predicted values. In contrast, Public administration and Educational and health services have the lowest unemployment rates, which is same as what is observed from the historical data. 

Finally, we are analyzing the difference of the unemployment between recent gradatues and non recent graduates, and its interactive effect with education_attainment.

The bar plot above (@ig-bar-recent-graduate-education-model) shows that the model predicts unemployment rates for individuals in the labor force with a Bachelor's degree as their highest educational attainment quite accurately, with recent graduates (aged 22–25) exhibiting notably higher unemployment than non-recent graduates. For individuals with a Master's degree, the model performs well for non-recent graduates but shows a larger gap in predictions for recent graduates, likely due to limited training data. Nevertheless, the model captures the real-world trend that recent graduates face greater challenges in the job market compared to older cohorts.
