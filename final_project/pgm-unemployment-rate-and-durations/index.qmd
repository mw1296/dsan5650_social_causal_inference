  This study investigates the causal relationships between age, occupation, race, and unemployment rates in the United States, applying probabilistic graphical modeling (PGM) to uncover latent dependency structures across demographic and industry variables. Using a PGM framework, we extend this approach to labor market data by constructing conditional dependence networks across two key dimensions: time (2015, 2024 and 2025) and group attributes (age, race, and industry). Specifically, the study examines recent college graduates (ages 22–24) relative to older individuals (25+), comparing their unemployment rates by major across 2024 and 2025. A second dimension of analysis focuses on industry-specific unemployment rate dynamics from 2015 to 2025, particularly in [retail], [arts], and [technology] sectors, and how these intersect with racial and age groups. In addition to rate-based measures, the study explores how unemployment duration has evolved between 2015 and 2025 across different occupations and age cohorts. This analysis seeks to identify whether certain groups—such as []—face longer or shorter periods of unemployment today compared to a decade ago, providing a more comprehensive view of labor market hardship. The model estimates the strength and direction of probabilistic dependencies using Bayesian structure learning algorithms, based on labor force aggregated data from BLS CPS datasets. The results indicate that recent college graduates in [] majors had a higher unemployment rate of [ ]% in 2025 H1 compared to [ ]% in 2024 H1. Additionally, the [retail], [arts], and [technology] industries experienced increased unemployment rates between 2015 and 2025, with respective changes of [ ], [ ], and [ ] percentage points. The findings also suggest that, consistent with earlier research, unemployment duration is negatively correlated with the unemployment rate by occupation, with industries exhibiting higher unemployment often associated with shorter average durations (Chien, Y., & Morris, P., 2016). The PGM framework reveals significant interactive effects between race and industry on unemployment, particularly among [e.g., Black or Hispanic workers] in the [e.g., retail or hospitality] sector. These findings contribute to the growing literature that leverages PGMs for social inference (e.g., Li et al., 2022), highlighting the model’s potential for uncovering structural labor inequalities over time and across population subgroups.

## Introduction

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
eruptions = [1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021]
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-timeline
#| fig-cap: Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma
#| fig-alt: An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 1))
plt.eventplot(eruptions, lineoffsets=0, linelengths=0.1, color='black')
plt.gca().axes.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)
plt.ylabel('')
plt.show()
```

```{python}
#| output: false

avg_years_between_eruptions = np.mean(np.diff(eruptions[:-1]))
avg_years_between_eruptions
```

Based on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every `{python} f"{avg_years_between_eruptions:.1f}"` years on average.

Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).

Eight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).

Data and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.

Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution

$$
p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
$$ {#eq-poisson}

where $\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.
